## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover or suspect a vulnerability you can report it via:

- **Email:** You can contact me directly at [nikkotilion@gmail.com](mailto:nikkotilion@gmail.com).

## Reporting Process
When you report a vulnerability, I commit to the following:

- I will confirm the receipt of your report within 14 business days.
- I will investigate the vulnerability and determine its severity.
- I will take action to remediate the vulnerability and address it if I consider it necessary.
- I will maintain the confidentiality of your report if requested and work with you to ensure responsible disclosure.

## Security Updates
I will publish security updates only if I consider it necessary. I strongly recommend that all users migrate to the brand new (SSTools4MC)[https://github.com/ngdplnk/SSTools4MC].
