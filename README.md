## Build SSTools4MC Installer by yourself

You can follow this steps if you want to build the SSTools4MC Installer from the source code by yourself.
Please note that this is not mandatory. You can always download the latest version of the installer from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ngdplnk/SSTools4MC_Legacy/releases/latest) page.

### Clone this Repository

First, clone/download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngdplnk/SSTools4MC_Legacy.git
```

### Install NSIS

You need to install the latest NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) version to build the installer. You can download it from [NSIS Official Website](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download). Be sure to follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Verify Files

Navigate to the `2-launcher` folder in the cloned repository. Ensure that you have the following files (there may be more, but you need to have at least these):

- `build.nsi`
- `icon.ico`
- `launcher.pyw`

If any of these files are missing, please download them directly from the repository.

You will use the `main.py` from the `1-stable` folder as your bundled version in the launcher you are building.

### Edit .nsi File

Open the `build.nsi` file in a text editor and replace the placeholders `<TYPE THE XXXX PATH HERE>` with the actual paths to your files, respectively. Save the changes.

### Compile the Installer

1. Open NSIS.
2. Select the option "Compile NSI Scripts".
3. Drag and drop the file you just edited into the NSIS window.
4. An installer for SSTools4MC will be created.
5. Enjoy!
